cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.13) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Dustin Falgout ]
  * AuthClient: Check for pam helper in subdirectory
  * fix typo

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cinnamon-screensaver-pam-helper.c: debug mode - don't print message strings, they may contain the password.

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * add libexec path

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * manager.py: Fix pam helper cancellation in LMDE - we have an existing workaround for LMDE that skips the fade-out when unlocking, due to another issue.  This causes our despawn_stage callback to be called immediately, which sets self.stage to None, before cancel_unlocking can be run.
  * keybindings.py: Don't allow the keyboard popup menu key to slip thru.
  * stage: Clear the clipboard if we're locked (should be inaccessible anyhow but...)
  * Add some tooltips to a few ui elements.
  * stage.py: Fix logic surrounding hiding/showing the floating widgets when power states change, or when a plugin is unable to run due to the power state.

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.11) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Vladimir Didenko ]
  * Move pam-helper binary to libexec directory - some distros forbid ELF binaries in /usr/share

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * packaging: Move cinnamon-screensaver-pam-helper to its own package

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Thu, 22 Dec 2016 15:43:30 +0000

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.10) serena; urgency=medium

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * Fix FSF address

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cinnamon-screensaver-pam-helper: Add a sleep to the stdin wait loop, make sure the helper is killed whenever the screensaver is deactivated.
  * manager.py: only try to cancel_unlocking if there is a stage.

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.9) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * authClient.py: Use a constructor for GBytes creation (needed in LMDE introspection), ignore a message sent prior to the auth client being initialized (user hit enter as a means of bringing up the unlock dialog.)

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Mon, 12 Dec 2016 15:29:50 +0000

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.8) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * debian/cinnamon-screensaver.install: fix packaging of cinnamon- screensaver-pam-helper.

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Sat, 10 Dec 2016 14:05:34 +0000

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.7) serena; urgency=medium

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * Change shebang
  * Change shebang

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * stage.py: Keep floating widgets centered within their GtkAlign region instead of using the padding CSS property - this can only ever work by taking monitor size into account.
  * stage - the unlock dialog can take up more than 1/3 the width of the screen, so account for its width when positioning floating widgets during Awake state.

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * Add missing -lXext
  * remove spaces

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Volume control: Don't crash when PA returns no default sink
  * l10n: Update POT file

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * stage.py: Regrab the stage if grab is broken (notably by fingerprint-helper's gui.)
  * Fix pam authentication to work with multi-factor, fingerprint, etc..
  * floating.py: Increase positioning delay to 30 seconds.
  * audioPanel.py: Don't show panel at all if no players are active.
  * Couple fixes: show floating widgets immediately upon sleep, add a description for AuthClient, send a failure notice when we fail.

  [ Dustin Falgout ]
  * Update pam config for multi-distro compatibility

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Add preference to disable floating widgets...
  * clock.py: Make clock preference apply everywhere (like our other prefs)
  * cinnamon-screensaver-main.py: use setproctitle to set the process name as "cinnamon-screensaver"
  * configure.ac: Fix regression from git conflict - originally from aad72c98f1df63
  * Add a build option to enable/disable use of setresuid/setresgid in the setuid.c file for some distributions.  The default behavior remains to *not* use this.
  * Override the background color to transparent for various 'primary' widgets, this reduces (but does not eliminate) the tendency to get a 'flash' when the screensaver spawns its window.
  * mediaPlayerWatcher.py: handle metadata more gracefully - some players can return arrays of artist info, some a string - handle either.

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Sat, 10 Dec 2016 11:48:37 +0000

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.6) serena; urgency=medium

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Thu, 24 Nov 2016 22:38:57 +0000

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.5) serena; urgency=medium

  * Remove position bar and position labels in infobar

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Thu, 24 Nov 2016 18:55:32 +0000

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.4) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Replace cinnamon-screensaver bin script with cinnamon-screensaver.c, to perform setuid checks and fixes prior to python and gtk starting.
  * utils.py: remove liveuser check, it doesn't work as expected.

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Wed, 23 Nov 2016 12:47:48 +0000

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.3) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Willy Sudiarto Raharjo ]
  * Declare GdkX11.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * events: For gtk < 3.18, skip the fade out animation, and immediately destroy the window.  Move the deactivate command into an idle callback, so we're not attempting to destroy the window while in the middle of processing a motion event.
  * passwordEntry.py: emulate Gtk.Entry.grab_focus_without_selecting() - the real call was recently removed, as it doesn't exist in Gtk 3.14, however the behavior is still necessary - tabbing between buttons and entry will cause the entire partial password to be selected, causing overwrite.  This restores the original functionality without requiring gtk 3.18+
  * Fixes for Betsy/Jessie:
  * panels: Remove separators.  Tweak spacing for keyboard layout icon in the gtk 3.18 css file.
  * utils.py: clean up get_user_name() calls.
  * Disable locking if pam files aren't found or if we're running as root.
  * utils.py: add 'liveuser' group check to user_can_lock() function.

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.2) serena; urgency=medium

  * pkg: Added missing dep on python3-gi-cairo

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Sun, 13 Nov 2016 13:13:58 +0000

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.1) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * pkg: Add intltool to build-dep
  * pkg: Don't depend on python3-xlib in LMDE
  * Layout/l10n: Fix minor visual issues

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * unlock/accountsServiceClient: don't cache the username and face path, instead fetch them from AccountsService when used.  Also, allow for no face image by not using a fallback generic image, and hiding the image widget if there is no face for it.
  * Remove some Gtk 3.18+ api calls - with a small change to GdkScreen updating, the stacking order is correct at stage construction and never changes.

  [ Willy Sudiarto Raharjo ]
  * ConsoleKit: Add lock/unlock signal.

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Sun, 13 Nov 2016 12:12:35 +0000

cinnamon-screensaver (3.2.0) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Rewrite

  [ itzexor ]
  * utils.py: add back alternate display manager support for user switching

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Terminate plugins more cleanly, terminate them when they're no longer visible, terminate them when we're on battery (and restart them when we get plugged back in), clean up handling of transition between plugin and wallpaper.
  * packaging: use pkg-config to figure out where our typelib/lib files go
  * cs-notification-watcher.c: ignore transient notifications (such as those from banshee on track changes)

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * Revert "Fix gtkdocize: GTK_DOC_CHECK not called in ./configure.ac"
  * Fix the gtkdoc issue properly

  [ Maximiliano Curia ]
  * Make AX_ macros optional and drop unused parts
  * Drop gnome-common, add autconf-archive build dependency

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Add media player widget, reorganize files a bit
  * Remove borders from infobar widgets
  * Add audio buttons to the focus chain
  * notifications: Ignore notifications from active media players
  * Fix some names and lint.
  * media player: handle metadata safely, and make sure artist-album string is handled properly depending on the data we have available.
  * Update README.md
  * Make volume and position bars draw alike, make it easier to theme both, tweak layout of the audiobar a bit.  Also, fix div by 0 when a track doesn't have a max position.
  * Rename Audio/InfoBar to Audio/InfoPanel
  * playerControl.py: Improve how we get h:m:s from the microseconds reported for position and track length.

  [ Corbin Auriti ]
  * Delete debug-screensaver.sh

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Theme work - ensure everything is reasonably able to be themed, and provide fallback styling if the currently selected theme doesn't supply anything - this is done by searching for the toplevel style class - "csstage" corresponding to the toplevel window for the screensaver.
  * Add separate theming for Gtk 3.20+, update .gitignore, load a css file appropriate to the current Gtk version at startup (if no theme support is found).  Fix error handling in mediaPlayerWatcher.py.
  * Update README.md, couple fixes to css files
  * update pot file
  * trackers: dump timer and connection list in debug mode after unlocking.
  * manager.py, stage.py: add some documentation.
  * More documentation..
  * Add some documentation to the unlock dialog, make the user image size definable in CSS, reimplement the AccountsService handling as a client singleton like every other service.
  * More cleanup, documentation
  * Finish documentation
  * Fix a couple regressions from documenting/refactoring
  * Stage: Listen for GdkScreen changes in size and number of monitors, and reconstruct the monitorViews as needed.
  * stage.py: Fix oversized info panel.
  * Add script for testing keyboard layouts.
  * Use XAppKbdLayoutController to interact with libgnomekbd for switching keyboard layouts and getting reliable flag icons.
  * unlock.py: Split out PasswordEntry and FramedImage to their own files.
  * Fix keyboard layout representation in the password entry.  GtkEntry is hardcoded to produce a menu-sized icon.  We supply a blank icon, and draw our own where it belongs, and at a better size.  This way, we can also provide themed text layout names as well, depending on user preference.
  * Add albumart widget.
  * finish implementing albumart preference.
  * stage: Don't let floating widgets overlap, catch a couple potential errors when loading pixbufs - namely when we interrupt it by skipping a track.
  * pyflakes cleanup
  * libcscreensaver: Fix new build warnings, fix shape extension detection for the event filter.
  * passwordEntry.py: Don't connect to draw and icon press signals if the keyboard layout controller is disabled.
  * Remove unused file.
  * proxies: Strip out unused interface elements to reduce lib size and runtime memory use (slightly.)
  * passwordEntry.py: Rework to stay in sync with XApp.KbdLayoutController changes.  Perform all rendering/loading of icons ourselves, depend on new icon package, use new cinnamon desktop preferences for flag/case settings.
  * Add preferences to lock down media keys, media player controls, notification counter.
