        The stage constructs itself and fades in asynchronously, and most importantly,
        as an idle callback.  This can cause the screensaver to not be fully active when
        a call to suspend is made.  Cinnamon-session calls to lock the screensaver
        synchronously, and if we don't completely finish construction before returning
        the dbus call completion, there's a chance the idle callback won't run until
        after the computer is resumed.

        We get an active-changed signal whenever the screensaver becomes completely active
        or inactive, so we'll queue up running iface.complete_lock() until we receive that signal.

        This allows the screensaver to be fully activated prior to cinnamon-session allowing
        the suspend/hibernate/whatever process to continue.

        For reference, this is called in cinnamon-session's csm-manager.c "manager_perhaps_lock"
        method.
